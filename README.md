Software and Scripts from my EEG Research

This repository contains software and scripts developed in our EEG research at Georgia State University.  Specific components are designed for BCI/EEG work with the Emotiv EPOC/EPOC+ systems.  However, much of the code can be used more generally.  Please cite and link to the author or repository when using.
